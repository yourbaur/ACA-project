So, the idea here is to use this concept to group products that match what different groups of customers like. This can help a lot in online stores because it means showing customers the products they're most likely to be interested in."

Its goal is to discern k clusters within the data, with each cluster denoting a cohort of customers sharing common traits. The algorithm hinges on centroids, acting as the central points of these clusters, and employs distance measures to allocate customers into the relevant clusters.\n"
