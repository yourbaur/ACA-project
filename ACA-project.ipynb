    "* Let's denote the fraction of the code that can be parallelized as ⨍\n",
    "* In this case, ⨍ represents the proportion of the code related to point assignment and centroid updates that can be parallelized.\n",
    "* Since we're parallelizing two main loops, we can assume that approximately 80% of the code is parallelizable, and ⨍ = 0.8\n",

    "3. Calculating the Theoretical Speed-up:\n",
    "* According to Amdahl's Law, the theoretical speed-up 𝑺 of a program with 𝑝 processors is given by the formula:\n",
    "![alt text](formulas/formula4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume we have 4 processors (𝑝=4).\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](formulas/formula5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Interpretation:\n",
    "The theoretical speed-up 𝑺 calculated using Amdahl's Law is 2.5 times faster than the serial execution. This means that if we parallelize 80% of the code across 4 processors, we can expect the program to run approximately 2.5 times faster compared to the serial execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Limitations and Considerations:\n",
    "Amdahl's Law provides an idealized theoretical estimate and may not perfectly reflect the real-world performance due to factors like overheads, communication costs, and varying execution times of different portions of the code.\n",
    "It assumes perfect scalability and uniform workload distribution, which may not always be achievable in practice."
